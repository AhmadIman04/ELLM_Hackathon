## What is Stellgin
This app called Stellgin is a personalized health management system designed for patients with diet-related conditions like obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. It helps patients track their meals, steps, and calorie intake in real time, while enabling doctors to monitor their progress, set consumption limits, and provide tailored dietary advice through a connected dashboard and AI-powered chatbot.

## Technical Architecture

This project consists of **two main user-facing systems** connected through a shared backend and real-time database:

* 📱 **Mobile App** for Patients
* 💻 **Web Dashboard** for Doctors

Both are seamlessly synchronized via **FastAPI backend** and **Firebase Realtime Database** to ensure real-time updates across users and platforms.
AI components powered by Google’s **Gemini models** are integrated through the backend (detailed separately in the *LLM Architecture* section).

---

## 📱 Mobile App (Patients)

Built with **React Native** (iOS & Android), the patient app empowers users to:

- 📊 **View daily nutritional limits** (set by their doctor)  
- 📸 **Upload meal photos** for nutritional analysis  
- 🤖 **Chat with a personalized AI assistant**  
- 🚶‍♂️ **Track daily physical activity** via built-in step tracker
- 📈 **Real-Time Dashboard Flow**

---

### 📊 View Daily Nutritional Limits Flow

1. **Doctor configures limits**  
   In the doctor’s dashboard, the physician sets or adjusts the patient’s daily targets for calories, sugar, fat, and sodium.  
2. **Firebase sync**  
   Limits are pushed instantly to Firebase Realtime Database.  
3. **App fetches limits**  
   On launch—or whenever they change—the mobile app retrieves the latest targets.  
4. **Display in UI**  
   The patient sees these limits on the home screen, with progress bars for each nutrient.  


---
---

### 📸 Upload Meal Photos for Nutritional Analysis Flow

1. **Launch picker**  
   User taps the food log section to open the camera or gallery.  
2. **Preprocess on-device**  
   Image is resized/compressed for optimal upload.  
3. **Secure upload**  
   Sent via FastAPI with authentication tokens.  
4. **Backend AI call**  
   Gemini processes the image and returns nutritional estimates.  
5. **Write to Firebase**  
   Results are stored under the patient’s record.  
6. **Update UI & history**  
   App displays values and logs the meal in the consumption history.

---

### 🤖 Chat with a Personalized AI Assistant Flow

1. **Open chat**  
   Tap the AI chatbot icon to launch the AI assistant.  
2. **Send query**  
   Type a question (e.g. “What should i eat for dinner?”) .  
3. **Route to backend**  
   FastAPI forwards the message plus patient context to Gemini.  
4. **Receive response**  
   Gemini returns tailored advice or suggestions.  

---

### 🚶‍♀️ Activity Tracking Flow

1. **Count steps**  
   Built-in tracker tallies daily steps.  
2. **Convert metrics**  
   Steps → distance → estimated calories burned.  
3. **Sync to Firebase**  
   Activity data is pushed in real time.  
4. **Doctor visibility**  
   Doctors can monitor patient activity live via the web dashboard.
   

### 📈 Real-Time Dashboard Flow

1. **Initialize dashboard component**  
   - When the patient opens the dashboard section, the app initializes real-time listeners to Firestore.

2. **Subscribe to Firestore data**  
   - **Activity data:** steps, distance, calories burned  
   - **Diet data:** meal records with calories, sugar, fat, sodium  

3. **Aggregate metrics**  
   - Compute daily totals and weekly summaries for both activity and diet.


---

## 💻 Doctor's Dashboard (Web)

Built using **React (Typescript)** and **Tailwind CSS**, the doctor's dashboard acts as a control center:

* 👩‍⚕️ Monitor multiple patients simultaneously
* 📊 View real-time patient stats:

  * Cumulative daily intake (calories, sugar, fat, sodium)
  * Step counts and calories burned
* ✍️ Set or adjust each patient’s **nutritional limits**
* 💬 Leave **personalized dietary suggestions or notes** that sync to the patient’s app

✅ All changes are **instantly synced** via Firebase, enabling two-way communication and live tracking.

---

## 🔗 Backend Services

The **FastAPI** backend serves as the central orchestrator, connecting apps, database, and AI services.
It exposes **REST APIs** for:

* 🔒 User authentication and management (patients & doctors)
* 📥 Uploading & processing meal photos
* 🤖 Handling AI chatbot queries
* 📝 Managing nutritional limits and suggestions
* 📊 Updating patient dashboards

### 🔄 Data Flow:

* All patient health data is stored in **Firebase Realtime Database**:

  * Meal records
  * Step counts & calorie burns
  * Doctor-set nutritional goals
  * Chatbot interaction logs

Both apps use Firebase’s realtime sync ➜ providing instant, seamless updates.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack Summary

| Component          | Tech Stack                       |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| **Mobile App**     | React Native                     |
| **Web Dashboard**  | React (Typescript), Tailwind CSS |
| **Backend**        | FastAPI (Python)                 |
| **Database**       | Firebase Realtime Database       |
| **AI Integration** | Gemini APIs (via Backend)        |



## 🤖 LLM Architecture Overview

AI functionality in this system is divided into **two core tasks**:  
- 🥗 **Meal Analysis** (using multimodal input)  
- 💬 **Personalized Chatbot Interactions**  

Both are powered by **Google’s Gemini models** and integrated through the FastAPI backend, which handles context building and API communication.

---

### 🥗 Meal Analysis (Multimodal Inference Flow)

1. **Patient uploads meal photo**  
   The mobile app sends the image to the backend via FastAPI.  

2. **Forward to Gemini 2.0 Flash**  
   The backend calls Gemini’s multimodal model, which can analyze the image and return structured nutritional data.

3. **AI estimates nutritional values**  
   - 🔥 **Calories**  
   - 🍬 **Sugar content**  
   - 🥓 **Fat content**  
   - 🧂 **Sodium levels**  

4. **Parse and store results**  
   The backend processes the AI response and writes the estimated values into the patient’s record in **Firebase Realtime Database**.

5. **Real-time updates**  
   Both the patient’s app and doctor’s dashboard reflect the new meal data instantly, thanks to Firebase’s sync mechanism.

> ✅ This architecture hides the AI model complexity from front-end apps while keeping updates **fast** and **real-time**.

---

### 💬 Chatbot Personalization (LLM with Contextual Data Flow)

1. **Patient sends chatbot query**  
   The user types a question (e.g., "Can I have dessert today?") in the app’s chat interface.

2. **Backend gathers live patient data**  
   From Firebase, the backend fetches:  
   - 🍬 **Current consumption stats:** calories, sugar, fat, sodium  
   - 📊 **Patient's current health data**  
   - ⚙️ **Doctor-set nutritional limits**  

3. **Build enriched prompt**  
   The backend combines the user’s query with their latest health data to form a rich, context-aware prompt.

4. **Call Gemini text model API**  
   This prompt is sent to Gemini’s LLM, which returns a **personalized** and **safe** response tailored to the patient’s condition.

5. **Return and display response**  
   The chatbot reply is delivered back to the app’s chat window, ready for the user to read and act on.

> 🔒 By using real-time health data and doctor-defined limits, every chatbot reply stays **relevant** and **clinically safe** for the patient.

---

## 🛠️ Why This Design?

- **Seamless updates**: Meal data and chatbot answers reflect the patient’s **real-time health status**.
- **Scalable**: Front-end apps stay lightweight—heavy AI processing is handled server-side.
- **Safe & personalized**: AI replies always consider the patient’s latest condition and doctor’s advice.
